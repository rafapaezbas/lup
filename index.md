### Documentation
Octaedre has been design with approachability in our heads, we have tried to create the most intuitive/easy interface for music sequencing. We recommend to start using it without reading any documentation, just plug your Novation Launchpad, open Octaedre, configure the midi clock input and midi output, press some buttons and see the magic happen!
Under this first simplicity layer, Octaedre has also some advance features very worthy to know. Triplets, polyrythms or melody sequencing are all possible. Check the [Octaedre overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafapaezbas/octaedre/feature/web/assets/manual_min.png) and follow the documentation to discover all you can do with the sequencer.

### Setup
Open the application and you will find two drop down menus. The one above sets the __midi clock input__ that Octaeder will receive. You can send the midi clock input from your daw or any other device able to send midi clock signal.
The second drop down menu is the __midi output__. That means the midi output port where Octaedre will send the midi signals. 
### Sequence
Press any the __sequencer__ buttons to activate a step in the sequence. You can also choose the __notes__ that the step will trigger. Default midi note is 64.
### Tracks
Every track corresponds and midi channel. Change the selected track pressing any of the __track__ buttons. You can mute/unmute a track pressing __Right shift +  track__.Change the tempo of the track using the __tempo modifier__ button. Change the length of the tracks pressing __Left shift + sequencer button__. The length of each track is independent, that allows to create polyrythms.
### Scene
There are 4 independent scenes. Change the scene pressing the __scene__ buttons. You can chain scenes by holding __Right shift__ and a sequence of the scenes.
### Pages
Change between tracks 1-8 and 9-16 using the __Page 1 / Page 2__ buttons.
### Triplets
Convert two steps in a triplet by holding a __sequencer button__ and pressing the next of the sequence. Color will change to violet and you can use the same combination to remove the triplet.
