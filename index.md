### Documentation
Octaedre has been design with approachability in our heads, we have tried to create the most intuitive/easy interface for music sequencing. We recommend to start using it without reading any documentation, just plug your Novation Launchpad, open Octaedre, configure the midi clock input and midi output, and try to create some simple rythms or melodies.
Under this first layer of simplicity, Octaedre has also some advance features very worthy to know. Triplets, polyrythms or melody sequencing are all possible. Check the [Octaedre overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafapaezbas/octaedre/feature/web/assets/manual_min.png) and follow the documentation to discover all you can do with the sequencer.

### Setup
Open the application and you will find two drop down menus. The one above sets the __midi clock input__ that Octaeder will receive. You can send the midi clock input from your daw or any other device able to send midi clock signal.
The second drop down menu is the __midi output__. That means the midi output port where Octaedre will send its midi signals. 
### Sequence
Press any of the __sequencer__ buttons to activate a step in the sequence. You can also choose the __notes__ that the step will trigger. Default midi note is 64.
### Tracks
Every track corresponds to midi channel. Change the selected track by pressing any of the __track__ buttons. You can mute/unmute a track by pressing __Right shift +  track__.Change the tempo of the track using the __tempo modifier__ button. Press __Left shift + sequencer button__ to change the length of the track. The length of each track is independent.
### Scene
There are 4 independent scenes. Press the __scene__ buttons to change the playing scene. You can chain scenes by holding __Right shift__ and a sequence of the scenes.
### Pages
Change between tracks 1-8 and 9-16 using the __Page 1 / Page 2__ buttons.
### Triplets
Convert two steps in a triplet by holding a __sequencer button__ and pressing the next of the sequence. Color will change to violet and you can use the same combination to remove the triplet. 
### Copy
To copy a step of the sequencer or a scene use the __copy__ button + the origin step/scene + the target step/scene. To copy a track just hold __copy__ + the target __track__ and the current track will be copied to the target.
