### Documentation
Octaedre has been design with approachability in our heads, we have tried to create the most intuitive/easy interface for music sequencing. We recommend to start using it without reading any documentation, just plug your Novation Launchpad, open Octaedre, configure the midi clock input and midi output, press some buttons and see the magic happen!
Under this first layer, Octaedre has also some advance features very worthy to know. Triplets, polyrythms or melody sequencing are all possible. Checkout the official [Octaedre user manual.]()
